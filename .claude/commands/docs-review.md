Read and understand the complete `@CLAUDE.md` file to understand the current project state, recent developments, and architectural changes. This command enforces the streamlined Context Continuity Protocol required for all Claude Code sessions.

**Context Continuity Protocol**:

1. **Read CLAUDE.md**: Read and analyze the comprehensive `@CLAUDE.md` file which contains:
   - Complete project overview and current status
   - Recent development sessions and accomplishments (Sessions 003-010)
   - Critical architectural patterns and implementations
   - Database schema evolution and API architecture
   - Development guidelines and best practices
   - Code quality metrics and learnings
   - All necessary context for immediate productivity

2. **Context Integration**: Understand:
   - Current development phase (Session 010 Complete: Communication Platform Backend)
   - Available features and infrastructure
   - Established patterns and conventions
   - Debug tools and development workflow

3. **Protocol Compliance**: Ensure full understanding of project state before proceeding with any user requests.

**This streamlined command implements the mandatory Context Continuity Protocol from CLAUDE.md and must be used at the start of every Claude Code session. CLAUDE.md serves as the single source of truth for all project knowledge.**
